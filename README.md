# Reading huge size of data which is bigger than RAM

## What is Dask and why do we use it?

Dask is a parallel computing library that scales the existing Python ecosystem. This tutorial will introduce Dask and parallel data analysis more generally.

Dask can scale down to your laptop and up to a cluster. Here, weâ€™ll use an environment you setup on your laptop to analyze medium sized datasets in parallel locally.

## Usage

- Install required modules with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Start `jupyter notebook`
- Put your csv file into project folder
- Set `blocksize` variable for partitions blocksizes
- Set `cols` variable to specify column names which is used in csv file
- Run all cells in ipynb
